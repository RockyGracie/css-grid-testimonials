               I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
               in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

               “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
               transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
               for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
               The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
               the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

               Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
               learning from their experiences was easy.

            <p class="testimonials__body">
               “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
               gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
               junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from

               Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
            </h2>
            <p class="testimonials__body">
               “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
               professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
               student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
               did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
               project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
               could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
               experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
               100% recommend! ”
